Hello! I am China Gem Patrice E. Santos. You can call me China. I am from Marilao, Bulacan. 
My favorite thing about computer science is that even though it is hard, it is undeniably satisfying as long as you made your codes work. I may not be that knowledgeable about this field when I chose to enter it but I honestly enjoyed computer science so well. 
Lastly, I am expecting to enjoy the class and to discover new things about computer science. Also, I am hoping that my skills will be developed more through this class. Thatâ€™s all and have a nice day!
